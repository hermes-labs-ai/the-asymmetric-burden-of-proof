# Security Policy

This repository is an archival package for a published research paper —
"The Asymmetric Burden of Proof: LLMs Show a Null-Result Asymmetry in a
Matched-Vignette Benchmark" (<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18867694>).
It ships no runtime software, no network service, and no production
deployment, so there is no conventional software attack surface to
secure here.

The repository does include small offline convenience scripts —
`verify.py` at the repository root, and another inside
`replications/2026-09-02-gemini-current-model/` — that check package
integrity, citation identity, published PDF bytes, and the archived
replication's raw records. They make no network calls, are not a
service, and are not designed to process untrusted input; they exist
only to let a reader confirm the archived files have not been altered.

## Reporting a problem

If you find a problem with the archived materials — a corrupted or
tampered file, a checksum mismatch, an error in the citation or metadata
files, or a concern about how this archive is represented — please report
it by opening a GitHub issue on this repository, or by email to
<roli@hermes-labs.ai>.

This is a solo-maintained research archive. Reports are read and
acknowledged in good faith, but no fixed response time or service-level
agreement is promised.

## Scope

This policy covers only the materials in this repository. It does not
cover the canonical Zenodo deposit, hermes-labs.ai, or any other Hermes
Labs repository.
